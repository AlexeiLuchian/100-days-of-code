## Blackjack

Usually I don't leave READMEs on beginner level projects, but I felt like I had to do it for this mini-project since it looks super clean for someone like me, a beginner-intermediate coder.  
  
I enjoyed working on this project, as you can see I did it all in one go and I tried to use all the advices I've stumbled upon recently while working on The Odin's Project and this course as well in order to write clean code, using functions only for a specific thing, using intuitive and easy-to-understand function and variable names, letting the code explain itself without using comments etc.  
  
If you can advice me with anything, please do it, THANK YOU!
